Most of the algorithms here are based upon or an edited version of [Hacking Secret Ciphers with Python](http://inventwithpython.com/hacking) (BSD Licensed)

### Implementations of some ciphers:

* [Caeser Cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
* [ROT13](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13)
* Reverse Cipher ( Not sure I can even call it a cipher! )


### TODO

* [Vigen√®re cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher)
